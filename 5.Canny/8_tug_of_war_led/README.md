These scripts for tog of war with LED. I use Canny 3 tiny pro and Arduino nano controllers.
Two controllers randomly generate signal with DAC for two color led. The most powerful signal  will made the led blink .

tug_of_war.cfd functional diagrams demonstrate ADC and DAC for Canny 3 tiny PRO with randomize composite functional block.

arduino_srdac - simple script for Arduino nano part.

P.S. To run these Canny (cfd) script you need to download Canny Lab 2.09 or above for free.
