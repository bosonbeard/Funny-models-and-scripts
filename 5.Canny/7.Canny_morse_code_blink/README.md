These functional diagrams demonstrate the application of the composite functional blocks in CannyLab 2.

The diagrams are designed for use with Canny 3 tiny and Canny 5 Nano controllers, but can be easily adapted to other Canny controllers.

After writing diagrams in the controller, its built-in LED will start blinking 2021 in Morse code.

P.S. To run these Canny (cfd) scripts you need to download Canny Lab 2.07 or above for free.
